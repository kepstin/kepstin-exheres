The primary thing that I keep in here is various MusicBrainz-related libraries and packages, including scm or development versions. In addition, there's a few development versions of gnome-related packages which sneak in now and then. I try to keep the scm packages masked, but there's probably not much in here that you really want to use. Let me know if you try and find problems, though!

Packages in here:
* Development and beta versions of Musicbrainz Picard.
