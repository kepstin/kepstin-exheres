The primary thing that I keep in here is scm or development versions of various gnome-related packages. I try to keep the scm packages masked, but there's probably not much in here that you really want to use. Let me know if you try and find problems, though!

Packages in here:
* @media-sound/rhythmbox@: Both a release version and scm version of rhythmbox. Some of the options can't be enabled because of missing deps, but all the basic features work fine. I should see about getting the release version into the media-unofficial repo, some day.
* @net-libs/webkit-gtk@: A scm version of webkit-gtk. Based on compnerd's exheres, I just updated it a bit.
* @net-www/epiphany@: A scm package for epiphany, to go with the webkit-gtk package.
* @sys-utisl/mdadm@: Release and scm versions of mdadm, the linux software raid tool. I really should get the release one in a more public repo. The scm version supports starting raid from udev, without init scripts or manual configuration!
* @x11-libs/cairo@: A scm package for cairo. This package has an extra patch for LCD filtering, but this shouldn't affect normal use (unless you customize a few settings, in which case your fonts will look nicer!). The patch is the main reason that I created the exheres; there's not _that_ much exciting stuff going on in cairo git.
